dClass - Pattern Classification Engine

dClass is an indexed pattern classification engine. dClass is capable of performing near constant time pattern classification. For an input of size M classified against an index of size N, dClass has worst case O(M) performance, even for large values of N. To accomplish this, dClass uses a dtree, a multi edge networked graph of sub pattern nodes. This structure is heavily optimized for searching, retrieval, and high performance on modern day CPUs (classification runtime is in the range of 10 microseconds on modern day hardware).

dClass introduces several classification pattern types: STRONG, CHAINED, WEAK, and NONE. These types can be coupled with regular expressions, absolute positioning, grouping, inheritance, duplicates, ranking, and directional proximity. This allows for an expressive index which is capable of handling complex context aware patterns like language as well as simpler pattern classifications like device detection, all under a unified syntax and API.

dClass is built in a modular fashion and allows for schema free data modeling. This means that multiple pattern indexes can be combined with their own custom classification language allowing for centralized domain specific classification while retaining near constant time performance.
